# How-to-Attract-Customers-ModileApp-Survey
<em>Based on the analysis of the survey results, which includes 1,552 observations and 16 questions, seven of which 
involve a multiple answer option, we have formed appropriate recommendations.</em>

The marketing team needs to focus primarily on three clusters of people that cover 52% of the audience. It is necessary 
to prefer one group of people for the greatest return, covering 19% of respondents.<br><br>

<strong>Who are these people?</strong>

1. Cluster 6 - 19%. This group most likely contains busy people (professionals) who use the phone as a distraction. 
They spend much free time there on entertainment, especially music and games. In doing so, they will focus on new trends 
and will not miss the opportunity to show off their purchases to others.<br>
<em>Possible marketing strategies:</em><br>
    - Targeting this group will have many benefits as they could promote the app through word of mouth.<br>
    - The app should have frequent updates and keep up with new trends but not be too time-consuming.<br><br>
    
2. Cluster 1 - 15%. Although this is a small cluster, it is easily targeted. This cluster consists of people who use their 
phones constantly but are very concerned with technology's role in people's lives. These people are also considered more introverted 
than usual.<br>
<em>Possible marketing strategies: </em><br>
    - Creating or marketing existing privacy features available on the app.<br>
    - Allowing an option for users to choose how anonymous they want to be.<br><br>

3. Cluster 2 - 18%. A group of people who carefully monitor their purchases and plan time for shopping. They are specifically looking 
for discounts and promotions. If they use the phone, it's not for entertainment, but most likely to find special groups on Facebook 
about shopping and hobbies and rarely chat about this. These people are likely parents who usually allow their children to use their 
phones.<br>
<em>Possible marketing strategies: </em><br>
    - Focusing marketing efforts to show parents the app is safe for children (non-violent, not addictive, etc.).<br>
    - Due to the nature of these careful customers, it would be more prudent to focus on the initial app price instead of in-app 
    purchases since these customers are not likely to consume them.
